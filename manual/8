Reference:
  * Peter Kogge, The Architecture of Symbolic Computers

    note: recommanded reading first two chapter if
    you are unfamiliar with the computation (programming).
    then the 4th chapter for lambda calculus. 
  * Alonzo Church, The Calculi of Lambda Conversion

    note: https://li-yiyang.github.io/reading/calculi-of-lambda-conversion/
    this is not complete yet, but this work (LVM REPL)
    should be enough as an appendix note
  * John McCarthy, etc, Recursive Functions of Symbolic
    Expressions and Their Computation by Machine, Part I

    search for the folded detailed explanation notes in
    the blog post
