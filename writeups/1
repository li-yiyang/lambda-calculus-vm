    LVM 1: Church Number Writeup
====================================
Just copy it and paste it into LVM REPL, the
result is:

    (λyb|y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(y(yb)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))

If you want, you could count by hand (233).

Or you could just use a more simplier program
to count the `y' to convert church number to
integer:

    def church_number_to_integer(expr : str, sym : str = "y") -> int:
        count = 0
        for char in expr:   # for all the characters in `expr'
            if char == sym: # if has `sym' symbol appearance
               count += 1   # increase count for `sym'
        return count - 1    # remove `sym' count in identifier list

So the real number is `233'. (see `1.py' for details)

Or if you thought it was not strictly enough,
you could also use `parse.py' to do the AST.

More: the task was made by the following code.

    .p                                    -> trun off pretty print
    .l(𝐬) (λxyz|y(xyz))                   -> successor
    .l(𝐩) (λxsz|x(λgh|h(gs))(λu|z)(λu|u)) -> predecessor
    .l(+) (λxy|y#𝐬x)                      -> addition
    .l(×) (λxys|x(ys))                    -> multiplication
    .l(∸) (λxy|y#𝐩x)                      -> monus subtraction
    .l(𝐞) (λbe|eb)                        -> b^e exp
    .d(0)                                 -> set recursion to 0
    ((λab|(#+ (#+ (#× (#𝐩 a) (#𝐞 b (#𝐩 a))) a) (#× a b))) #3 #10) -> ((((3 - 1) * (10 ^ (3 - 1))) + 3) + (3 * 10))

Tips: here hides some drawbacks of literal macro,
if you just use expression

    ((λxy|(#+(#+(#×(#𝐩x)(#𝐞y(#𝐩x)))x)(#×xy)))#3#10)

The result is wrong: (λa|(λz|(a((aa)z)))), because simple
macro is just literally replacing string and has no
safty check for AST and context.
